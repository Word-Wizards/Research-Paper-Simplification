Sentence Simplification (SS) can be done using fine-tuned Transformer models, specifically BERT and GPT-2. Transformer models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing by using self-attention mechanisms to understand and generate text. These models can be pre-trained on extensive text data retrieved from the research paper and then fine-tuned for specific tasks. BERT is a bidirectional model that considers the context from both sides of a word, while GPT-2 is unidirectional, making it faster.
